1951-084,"(Also referred to as the Miracle Decision), was a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court which largely marked the decline of motion picture censorship in the United States.

More generally, the court ruled that a private organization such as the BSA may exclude a person from membership when &quot;the presence of that person affects in a significant way the group&apos;s ability to advocate public or private viewpoints&quot;. In a five to four decision, the Supreme Court ruled that opposition to homosexuality is part of BSA&apos;s &quot;expressive message&quot; and that allowing homosexuals as adult leaders would interfere with that message",L

The case was brought by a widower who was denied survivor benefits on the grounds that he had not been receiving at least one-half support from his wife when she died. Justice Brennan delivered the opinion of the court, ruling unconstitutional the provision of the Social Security Act which set forth a gender-based distinction between widows and widowers, whereby Social Security Act survivors benefits were payable to a widower only if he was receiving at least half of his support from his late wife, while such benefits based on the earnings of a deceased husband were payable to his widow regardless of dependency. The Court found that this distinction deprived female wage earners of the same protection that a similarly situated male worker would have received, violating due process and equal protection.",
1974-070,"A decision by the United States Supreme Court, which unanimously held that the gender-based distinction under 42 U.S.C. _ 402(g) of the Social Security Act of 1935 which permitted widows but not widowers to collect special benefits while caring for minor children violated the right to equal protection secured by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.",
2000-028,"A decision of the Supreme Court of the United States concerning the constitutionality of funding restrictions imposed by the United States Congress. At issue were restrictions on the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), a private, non-profit corporation established by Congress. The restrictions prohibited LSC attorneys from representing clients attempting to amend (or challenge) existing welfare law. The case was brought by Carmen Velazquez, whose LSC-funded attorneys sought to challenge existing welfare provisions, believing it was the only way to get Velazquez financial relief. The Court ruled that this specific restriction violated the free speech guarantees of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Because LSC facilitated &quot;private&quot; speech that of its grantees the restrictions did not simply regulate government speech. Because the restrictions blocked attempts to change only a specific area of law, the Court held, they could not be considered viewpoint-neutral; the government is prohibited from making such viewpoint-based restrictions of private speech.",
1967-117,"A decision of the Supreme Court of the United States. This decision deals primarily with the civil rights of illegitimate children, specifically in regards to their ability to sue on a deceased parent&apos;s behalf.

2002-039,"A First Amendment case decided in the Supreme Court of the United States. Three defendants were convicted in two separate cases of violating a Virginia statute against cross burning. In this case, the Court struck down that statute to the extent that it considered cross burning as prima facie evidence of intent to intimidate. Such a provision, the Court argued, blurs the distinction between proscribable &quot;threats of intimidation&quot; and the Ku Klux Klan&apos;s protected &quot;messages of shared ideology.&quot; However, cross-burning can be a criminal offense if the intent to intimidate is proven.",

In a 7_2 decision, the Court upheld the lower court decisions and nullified the law, ruling that video games were protected speech under the First Amendment as other forms of media.

Several of the Court&apos;s justices suggested that the issue might need to be re-examined in the future, considering the changing nature of video games and their continuously improving technology.",L
1964-121,"A landmark case in the United States about access to contraception. The case involved a Connecticut &quot;Comstock law&quot; that prohibited any person from using &quot;any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception.&quot; The court held that the statute was unconstitutional, and that &quot;the clear effect of [the Connecticut law ...] is to deny disadvantaged citizens ... access to medical assistance and up-to-date information in respect to proper methods of birth control.&quot; By a vote of 7_2, the Supreme Court invalidated the law on the grounds that it violated the &quot;right to marital privacy&quot;, establishing the basis for the right to privacy with respect to intimate practices.

2007-071,"A landmark case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Second Amendment protects an individual&apos;s right to possess a firearm, unconnected with service in a militia, for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home, and that Washington, D.C.&apos;s handgun ban and requirement that lawfully-owned rifles and shotguns be kept &quot;unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock&quot; violated this guarantee. It also stated that the right to bear arms is not unlimited and that guns and gun ownership would continue to be regulated. Due to Washington, D.C.&apos;s special status as a federal district, the decision did not address the question of whether the Second Amendment&apos;s protections are incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment against the states, which was addressed two years later by McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010) in which it was found that they are. It was the first Supreme Court case to decide whether the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.",L

1972-048,"A landmark decision issued in 1973 by the United States Supreme Court on the issue of the constitutionality of laws that criminalized or restricted access to abortions. The Court ruled 7_2 that a right to privacy under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment extended to a woman&apos;s decision to have an abortion, but that this right must be balanced against the state&apos;s interests in regulating abortions: protecting women&apos;s health and protecting the potentiality of human life. Arguing that these state interests became stronger over the course of a pregnancy, the Court resolved this balancing test by tying state regulation of abortion to the third trimester of pregnancy.",L

The actual malice standard requires that the plaintiff in a defamation case, if that person is a public official or public figure, prove that the publisher of the statement in question knew that the statement was false or acted in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity.

It stated in clear terms that, pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment rules regarding search and seizure applied to state governments. While this principle had been outlined in other cases, such as Mapp v.

The U.S. government had attempted to revoke the citizenship of Beys Afroyim, a man born in Poland, because he had cast a vote in an Israeli election after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen. The Supreme Court decided that Afroyim&apos;s right to retain his citizenship was guaranteed by the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. In so doing, the Court struck down a federal law mandating loss of U.S. citizenship for voting in a foreign election thereby overruling one of its own precedents, Perez v.

A majority of judges held that limits on election spending in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 _608 are unconstitutional. In a per curiam (by the Court) opinion, they ruled that expenditure limits contravene the First Amendment provision on freedom of speech because a restriction on spending for political communication necessarily reduces the quantity of expression.

The court, however, did specify that an arrest warrant (as opposed to a search warrant) would have sufficed for entry into the suspect&apos;s residence if there had been reason to believe that the suspect was within the home.

1970-134,"A United States Supreme Court case in which the Court determined that state restrictions on welfare benefits for legal aliens but not for citizens violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court invalidated an Arizona law that required citizenship or 15 years of residence to receive welfare benefits. The 9-0 decision was written by Harry A. Blackmun. The state argued that rational basis review should apply, which would require the non-citizen to prove that the law served no conceivable legitimate state interest, or alternatively that the law was not rationally related to the government&apos;s purpose. However, the court applied the strict scrutiny standard, holding, &quot;Aliens as a class are a prime example of a &apos;discrete and insular&apos; minority for whom such heightened judicial solicitude is appropriate.",

The decision effected identified that some commercial speech may have weaker First Amendment free speech protections than non-commercial speech and that states can compel such commercial speech to protect their interests; future cases have relied on the &quot;Zauderer standard&quot; to determine the constitutionality of state laws that compel commercial speech as long as the information to be disclosed is &quot;purely factual and uncontroversial&quot;.,

1997-096,"A United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act (Coal Act) constituted an unconstitutional regulatory taking of property which required the Act to be invalidated. The import of this decision is that it was made in the context of a purely economic regulation. The plurality examines the statute and its resultant harm as an ad hoc factual inquiry based on factors delineated in Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, such as the economic impact of the regulation, its interference with reasonable investment backed expectations, and the character of the governmental action. The decision thereby moved beyond the traditional notions of equal protection which had been applied to economic regulation since the time of Lochner v. New York, requiring extreme deference to Congress, and applied a regulatory takings analysis to the problem resulting in a much less deferential result. While the plurality recognizes that this is not a traditional takings case where the government appropriates private property for public use, they also state this is the type of case where the &quot;Armstrong Principle&quot; of preventing the government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole. However, while the plurality seems to invalidate this particular law on takings grounds, the concurrences and the dissents warn of such an analysis as this should actually be examined under substantive due process or ex post facto theories.",

1976-117,"A United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that an East Cleveland, Ohio zoning ordinance that prohibited a grandmother from living with her grandchild was unconstitutional. Writing for a plurality of the Court, Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. ruled that the East Cleveland zoning ordinance violated substantive due process because it intruded too far upon the &quot;sanctity of the family.&quot; Justice John Paul Stevens wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment in which he agreed that the ordinance was unconstitutional, but he based his conclusion upon the theory that the ordinance intruded too far upon the Moore&apos;s ability to use her property &quot;as she sees fit.&quot; Scholars have recognized Moore as one of several Supreme Court decisions that established &quot;a constitutional right to family integrity.&quot;",

1955-004,"A United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that the Kellogg Company was not violating any trademark or unfair competition laws when it manufactured its own Shredded Wheat breakfast cereal, which had originally been invented by the National Biscuit Company (later called Nabisco). Kellogg&apos;s version of the product was of an essentially identical shape, and was also marketed as &quot;Shredded Wheat&quot;; but Nabisco&apos;s patents had expired, and its trademark application for the term &quot;Shredded Wheat&quot; had been turned down as a descriptive, non-trademarkable term. The Court therefore &quot;forcefully applied the principle that once a patent has expired, its benefits are to be freely enjoyed by the public.&quot; Kellogg has been called possibly &quot;the Supreme Court&apos;s most versatile and influential trademark decision&quot;. It had a direct impact on the structure of the Lanham Act and is a &quot;routine starting point for analysis in trademark opinions in lower courts.",

The case also held that the doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), which allows state officials to be sued in their official capacity for prospective injunctive relief, was inapplicable under these circumstances, because any remedy was limited to the one that Congress had provided.",
